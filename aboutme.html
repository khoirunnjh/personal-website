Hello! My name is Khoirun Najihah binti Abdul Haris. You can call me 
Khoirun or Najihah or any nickname that has a good meaning to it.
Soon I will be turning 20 years old on 7 December 2021, although
according to the Islamic calendar I'm already 20 because my birthday was
on 21 Ramadhan which has already passed. 
<br>
<br>
I live in a small hometown called “Bandar Kinrara” which is located at 
Puchong Selangor. I grew up there and I lived with my parents and my 3 
siblings. I have 1 sister and 2 brothers which makes me the middle child. 
<br>
<br>
Throughout my 20 years I have never really experienced moving to places 
because I have always stayed in Puchong, Selangor in a small town called 
“Bandar Kinrara”. I was born and raised in Puchong, I even went to schools 
there and met my best friends there. I love my hometown because all the 
necessities can be acquired here such as mosques, supermarkets, a variety of 
restaurants, playgrounds and many more. Although, after I finished my 
high school years, I had the chance to stay in Kedah to pursue my diploma in 
Library Science at UiTM, Sg. Petani but sadly due to pandemic I only manage 
to live there for 1 semester only and a quarter of semester 2. I am about to 
graduate somewhere between July and August. 
<br>
<br>
Secondly, during my pastime I love listening to music. I listen to all genres 
of music from pop to rock. If the lyrics and melody are good then I liked it. 
Musics has always played the important role in my life because from musics, 
I learn English and sometimes the lyrics manage to grasp the unspoken 
feelings. Here is a playlist of my favourite songs at the current moment.
<a href="playlist.html" target="_self">Enjoy!</a>
<br>
<br>
My biggest passion in life is to help others. During high 
school, my ambition was to be a therapist or counsellor because I wanted
to help those who are struggling with their traumatic past, give advice that
could save their life, and made them understand themselves better as well
as spreading awareness regarding mental illness. Although, being a therapist
and studying about psychology was my passion but I am glad that I decided 
to continue this course as I have exposed to many new knowledge and skills 
such as how to look for authentic information, using OPAC, Adobe software 
and last but not least learn how to do coding from scratch. Even though 
being a librarian is 2 different things but I realized that even being a librarian, 
I can still continue to fulfill my passion in life which is to help others. I really 
hope by the end of this diploma I will be given an opportunity to have a 
career as a Librarian. 
<br>
<br>
Finally, my goals in 2021 is to lose weight, eat healthy, graduate on time, 
get a job and start reading books again because last year, due to not taking 
care of myself properly, I gained a lot of weight as I was munching on a lot 
of junk food and also I hope I gained more new knowledge even after 
I graduate. I hope by the end of this year, I will get to achieve all of my goals.
